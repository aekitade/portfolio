				<h1 class="project-title">Testing</h1>
				<p class="project-description">Before high school, I had never worked with black and white or film photography. But after taking a couple of film photography classes in high school, I became more interested in both film and editing digital photos from color to black and white. The overall difference between black and white versus full color caught my interest because I kept wondering how my usual digital photography would feel if I made such an easy and quick edit.</p>
